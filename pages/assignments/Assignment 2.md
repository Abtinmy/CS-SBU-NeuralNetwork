**Artificial Neural Networks**

2nd Assignment - Shahid Beheshti University - Master’s Program March 20, 2023

**Due date: April 7 **

**Exercise 1**

What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? Write their formulas and compare them with each other.

**Exercise 2**

What is exploding and vanishing gradients in neural networks? How can Adam optimizer help us with them? Is LeakyReLU better or ReLU in avoiding vanishing gradients?

**Exercise 3**

What is BCE loss? When should we use BCE and when should we use MSE? 

**Exercise 4**

How can we avoid overfitting? Name 3 methods and explain them in detail.

**Exercise 5**

Does dropout slow down training? Does it slow down inference (i.e., making predictions on new instances)? What about MC dropout?

**Exercise 6**

What is the problem that Glorot initialization and He initialization aim to fix?

**Exercise 7**

Using FashionMNIST data, a sample dataset is created ([**Link**](https://github.com/Abtinmy/CS-SBU-NeuralNetwork/raw/main/assignments/Assignment%202/Dataset.zip)) with all of the pixels in the center column of the photos set to zero. Also, their real values are extracted and saved in a CSV file for each image. It is expected that you:

- Split the data into train and test sets.
- Implement an MLP in order to predict the missing values in the images.
- Report the accuracy of the model on the test set and visualize the final images predicted by the model.
- Utilizing various enhancing techniques try to boost the performance of the model including:
  * Batch Normalization layers
  * Dropout layers
  * Different activation functions and comparing their performance
  * Learning rate scheduling
  * L1, L2 Regularization
  * Different Weight initialization (*EXTRA PONIT*)
  * Early stopping (*EXTRA PONIT*)
  * Utilizing different optimizers and comparing their performance (*EXTRA PONIT*)
